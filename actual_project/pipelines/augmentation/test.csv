 calculating the individual revenues for each category.

First, calculate the revenue from clothing:
\[
\text{Clothing Sales} = \text{Total Sales} \times 0.35 = \$2880 \times 0.35 = \$1008
\]

Next, calculate the revenue from footwear:
\[
\text{Footwear Sales} = \frac{\text{Total Sales}}{5} = \frac{\$2880}{5} = \$576
\]

Now, subtract both clothing and footwear revenues from the total sales to determine the electronics revenue:
\[
\text{Electronics Sales} = \text{Total Sales} - (\text{Clothing Sales} + \text{Footwear Sales})
= \$2880 - (\$1008 + \$576)
= \$2880 - \$1584
= \$1296
\]

Thus, the revenue from electronic items is $1296.

How many average flights does Janice walk (up and down) in a single day?","To find out how many average flights Janice walks each way, we need to calculate both directions separately first.
For going up: She goes up 3 floors five times per day, which equals <<3*5=15>>15 upward movements.
For going down: She descends three floors three times per day, resulting in <<3*3=9>>9 downward movements.
Adding these two gives us a total movement count before considering the elevator usage: <<15+9=24>>24 overall moves.

However, since she uses the elevator for half of her trips:
- For walking up: Halfway through his journey implies he would have gone through half as many steps if all were walked; thus it should be calculated by dividing our current value by two - hence <<15/2=7.5>>7.5.
- Similarly for walking down: Also halved due to elevator use so it becomes <<9/2=4.5>>4.5.

Finally adding these values together yields an average flight count over one round trip:

Over a single working week, she ascends these four flights six times and descends them four times. However, three-quarters of her trips involve using an elevator instead of walking. What is the average number of flights Sarah walks per round trip?","To determine how many average flights Sarah walks per round trip:

First, let’s calculate how many times she actually climbs stairs:
- Ascending: She goes up four floors six times per day, which totals <<4*6=24>>24 upward movements per day. Over a week, this amounts to <<24*7=168>>168 upward movements.
- Descending: She descends four floors four times per day, summing to <<4*4=16>>16 downward movements per day. Over a week, this sums to <<16*7=112>>112 downward movements.

Next, consider that three-quarters of her trips are taken with the elevator:
- Thus, for ascending: Three-quarters implies he would have gone through three-quarters as many steps if all were walked; therefore it should be calculated by multiplying our current value by one-quarter - hence <<168*(1/4)=42>>42.
- Similarly for descending: Also reduced due to elevator use so it becomes <<112*(1/4)=28>>28.

Now we combine these values to find out how many actual stair-climbing moves there are over one round trip:
<<42 + 28 = 70 >>This indicates that over one complete cycle between ascent and descent,
Sarah effectively makes **70** moves involving physical stair climbing.

\[ \text{Total spent on drinks} = \text{Cost per drink box} \times \text{Number of drink boxes} \]

\[ \$149.90 = \$14.99 \times 10 \]

Adding both expenditures gives us the total amount spent:
\[ \$32.50 + \$149.90 = \$182.40 \]

Mary gave a payment of \( \$200.00\). To find out how much change she should receive, we subtract the total expenses from the payment given:

Additionally, she rents a car for $20 per day and spends $150 on groceries every four weeks. How much does Sarah spend on travel and lifestyle expenses in a month?","To find out how much Sarah spends on travel and lifestyle expenses in a month, we need to break down her costs:

1. **Public Transport Cost:**
   - Daily distance traveled: \(<<\text{daily\_public\_transport\_distance\_km}>>\) km/day.
   - Monthly distance traveled: \(<<\text{daily\_public\_transport\_distance\_km} \times \text{days\_in\_month}>>\) km/month.
   - Total monthly cost: \(<<\text{public\_transport\_cost\_per_km} \times (\text{daily\_public\_transport\_distance\_km} \times \text{days\_in\_month})>>\) dollars/month.

2. **Car Rental Cost:**
   - Number of days renting the car each month: \(<<\text{days Car rented Per Month)>>\) days/month.
   - Total monthly cost: \(<<\text{car rental cost per day} \times (\text{days Car rented Per Month})>>\) dollars/month.

3. **Grocery Shopping Expenses:**
   - Weekly grocery shopping expenses: \(<<\text{weekly grocery shopping expenses dollars}}\) dollars/week.
   - Number of weeks in a month: \(<<\text{weeks In Month)>>\) weeks/month.
   - Total monthly cost: \(<<(\text{weekly grocery shopping expenses dollars} \times \text{weeks In Month})>>\) dollars/month.

Finally, summing all these costs gives us the total monthly expenditure:
\[Total Travel and Lifestyle Costs Per Month = Public Transport Cost Per Month + Car Rental Cost Per Month + Grocery Shopping Expenses Per Month.\]

Let's calculate it step-by-step:
- Public Transport Cost Per Month:
\[Cost_{Transport} = <<(0.25 \times (10 \times 30))=\$75>>\]
- Car Rental Cost Per Month:
\[Cost_{Rental} = <<(20 \times 15)=\$300>>\]
- Grocery Shopping Expenses Per Month:
\[Cost_{Groceries} = <<(150 \times 4)=\$600>>\]

Adding these together:
\[Total Travel and Lifestyle Costs Per Month= \$75 + \$300 + \$600= \$975.\]
